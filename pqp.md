## Overview
This document describes the People Quest Protocol. The protocol aims to reimagine the way people find new valuable connections. In a simple list, it tells the whole protocol flow:
- How any person/user lists all his interest tags.
- How devices passively scan for other peers through Bluetooth(BLE).
- Defines secure networking(handshakes, connection establishment/keep-alive, messaging).
- Defines private message exchange format.
- Specs out the way devices understand whenever the peers are interested in connecting to each other.

## Motivations
- Almost every person in developed and developing countries nowadays has a device in everyday usage to informationally stay connected to the whole world and their tribes through the Internet or specifically Web2.0. The Web2.0 has been serving us well, but through time, known drawbacks, which can be ignored at the beginning of the development, have to be fixed, or they will become a source of performance losses, security breaches, etc., as with any technology out there. Luckily, recent days show lots of effort from enthusiasts worldwide, aiming to improve the current state of the Web, known as Web3.0. Most of the ongoing work in this sphere focuses on innovations(Blockchains) and core infrastructure(IPFS) for the new Web. At the same time, there are plenty of existing Web2.0 applications that need to be migrated or reimagined to support Web3.0 core principles efficiently, like social networking. Here we can observe lower interest, though the field is essential globally. Fortunately, some projects are pushing the goal forward, like Berty. Still, it is reasonable to support the effort furthermore, and this document describes one of the core pieces and foundation for Web3.0 social networking. //TODO: Add references to projects and to Web2.0 drawbacks.
